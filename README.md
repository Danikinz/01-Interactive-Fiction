# Bartender
MSCH-C220 Project 

## Theme 
This game was heavily inspired by own experiences and struggles in determining and suitable, and most importantly, likeable career path. I wanted to create a story with a soft ambience that player's who were going through similar struggles could relate to. The story takes place in the city between the player's home, office and local bar. 

## Gameplay 
The main objective of the game is to navigate through the story as you best see fit. There are multiple endings to choose from as you progress throughout the story. 

## Impediments 
You might notice the appearance of a score tracker and collected item, both of which were requirements for the project. I found it difficult to justify a score tracker for this type of story, and as such simply tacked it as part of the requirements. Lastly, there were some varying problems in the code for keeping track and displaying instances of a selected item. 

## Implementation
Built using Visual Studio Code, Twine 2.3.14, and Python 3.9.6
